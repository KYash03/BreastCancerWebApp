# Breast Cancer Web App

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the [Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Streamlit, and Tableau. It includes the creation of a Tableau dashboard for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature distribution comparison between diagnosis classes.

## Key Features
- **Tableau Dashboard**: Created a dashboard to visualize and explore the dataset, comparing feature distributions for different diagnosis classes.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Individually created and hosted a [Streamlit app](https://kyash03-breastcancerwebapp-main-ckdp68.streamlit.app) on GitHub, allowing users to input values and predict breast cancer sample malignancy. The Support Vector Classifier model used achieved an accuracy score of 98%.
